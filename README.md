## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design a multi-tier software solution to implement a library management system and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. We are developing a website that will facilitate basic library processes for both patrons and employees of the library, such as item management (returning/borrowing books, archiving books, managing inventory, etc.), managing employee schedules, and registering new library members.

This system will be implemented by a team of 6 individuals and involved the use of requirements engineering, software development and design, system validation, and automatic software delivery.

## Running the Project
The backend of this project can be run locally by cloning this GitHub repository using the URL: https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2021/project-group-02.git <br />
The `LibrarySystem-Backend` repository can then be run as a Spring Boot App. The application will be hosted at http://localhost:8080/ and can be tested using the Postman application.
